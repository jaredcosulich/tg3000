We can think of turtle commands as a way to draw geometric figures on
a computer display. But we can also regard them as a way to describe
figures. Let's compare turtle descriptions with a more familiar system
for representing geometric figures --- the Cartesian coordinate system, in
which points are specified by two numbers, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates relative to a pair of axes drawn in the plane. To put Cartesian coordinates
into our computer framework, imagine a ``Cartesian turtle'' whose moves
are directed by a command called <span class='textsc'>setxy</span>. <span class='textsc'>setxy</span> takes two numbers as
inputs. These numbers are interpreted as at and y coordinates, and the
turtle moves to the corresponding point. We could draw a rectangle with
<span class='textsc'>setxy</span> using
