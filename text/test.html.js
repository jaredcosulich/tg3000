\chapter{Introduction to Turtle Geometry}
\begin{quote}We start with the simplest vocabulary of images, with ``left'' and ``right'' and ``one, two, three,'' and before we know how it happened the words and numbers have conspired to make a match with nature: we catch in them the pattern of mind and matter as one.

Jacob Bronowski, {\em The Reach of Imagination}\end{quote}

This chapter is an introduction on three levels. First, we introduce you to a new kind of geometry called turtle geometry. The most important thing to remember about turtle geometry is that it is a mathematics designed for exploration, not just for presenting theorems and proofs. When we do state and prove theorems, we are trying to help you to generate new ideas and to think about and understand the phenomena you discover.
